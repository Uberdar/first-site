<p id="desc">If you live to rock, this is where you belong.
Rockerboys are the street poets, social con­ sciences and rebels of the 2000's. With the advent of digital porta-studios and garage laser disk mastering, every Rocker with a message can take itto the street; put it in the record stores, bounce it off the comsats.
Sometimes, this message isn't something the Corporations or the Government wants to hear. Sometimes what you say is going to get right in the faces of the powerful people who really run this world. Butyou don't care, because as a Rockerboy, you know it's your
place to challenge authority, whether in straight-out protest songs that tell it like it is, or just by playing kick-ass rock n' roll to get the people away from the TV sets and into the Streets. You have a proud history as a Rockerboy— Dylan, Springsteen, Who, Elvis, the Stones—the legions of hardrock heroes who told the truth with screaming guitars and gut-honest lyrics.
As a Rockerboy, you have the power to get the people up—to lead, inspire and inform.
A song from you can give the timid courage, the weak stren-gth, and the blind vision.
Rockerboy legends have led armies against Corpo­ rations and Governments.
Rockerboy songs have ex­ posed corruption, brought down dictators. It's a lot of power for a guy doing gigs every night in another city.
Butyou can handle it. After all—you came to play!</p>
