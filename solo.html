<p id="desc">You were re-born with a gun in your hand — the flesh and blood hand, not the metallic weapons factory that covers most of your other arm. Whether as a freelance guard and killer- for-hire, or as one of the Corporate cybersoldiers that enforce business deals and the Company's "black op­ erations", you're one of the elite fighting machines of the Cyberpunk world.
Most Solos have put in military time, either in a Corpo­ rate army or in one of the Government's continual "police actions" around the world.
<br> As the battle damage piles up, you start to rely more and more upon hardware—cyber­limbs for weapons and armor, bio-program chips to increase your reflexes and aware­ ness, combat drugs to give you that edge over your opponents. 
<br>When you're the best of the best, you might even leave the ranks of Corporate samurai and go ronin— freelancing your lethal talents as killer, body­ guard or enforcer to whoever can pay your very high fees.
Sounds good? There's a price—a heavy one.
You've lost so much of your original meat
body that you're almost a machine. Your killing reflexes are so jacked upthatyou have to restrain yourself from going beserk at any moment. Years of combat drugs taken to keep the edge have given you terrifying addictions. You can't trust anyone—your mother, your friends, your lovers— no one.
<br>One night you sleep in a penthouse condo in the City— the next in a filthy alley on the Street. But that's the price of being the best.
And you're willing to pay it. Because you're a Solo.</p>
