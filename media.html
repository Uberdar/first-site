<p id="desc">They're bending the truth out there. And you're go­ ing to stop them. Some­ one has to do it. The Cor­ porations rule the world.
They dump toxics, desta- bilize economies and com m it m urder with equal impunity. The Gov- ernm ent w o n 't stop them—they own the Gov- ernment. The only thing between the Corpora­ tions and world domina­ tion is the Media. And that's you.
You've got a videocam and a press pass—and you're not afraid to use them. You're a national figure, seen nightly on a million TV sets worldwide.
You've gotfans, contracts and your own Corporation backing you.
They can't make you disappear. When you dig down for the dirt and slime the corrupt officials and Corporate lapdogs try to cover up, you can dig deep. The next morning, you can putthe details oftheircrimes all over the screamsheets and vidscreens. Then the Government has to act.
A week ago, you followed a hot lead and discovered a medical corporation dumping illegal drugs on the Street. This week, you're uncovering a secret Corporate war in South America—a war with jets, bombs, and cy­ bertroops that's killed almost seven thou­ sand innocent people. Each new story you get to the air is one more blow for freedom and justice. Not to mention ratings. it isn't easy. They've tried to pressure your
Mediacorp dozens of times. You've had sto­ ries suppressed—once, Corporate pressure forced them to cancel your news show. Each time, you went to the top, backed by your news director and your crew, and fought to get the story out. Three or four times, they tried to kill you—that's why your backup's a crack Solo bodyguard and you've got one of the top 'Runners in the business digging through the Net to back your stories. You have to be good, or else.
Your 'Runner's just phoned in with a hot lead. He's found a line on twenty tons of illegal weapons being shifted to a port in Bolivia— possibly nuclear. You grab your gear and flag your backup. You're going to break those bastards.
This time, for sure.</p>
