<p id="desc">In the old days, they would have called you a yuppie—a hard driven, fast-track MBA on his way up the Corporate ladder. Sure, it's selling your soul to the Company, but face it; the Corporations rule the Cyberpunk world. They control governments, mar­ kets, nations, armies—you name it. And you know that whoever controls the Cor­ porations controls every­ thing else.
Right now, your life as a junior executive is anything but easy. There are guys underneath you who'd kill for a shot at your job. There are guys over you who'd kill to keepyou outof theirjobs.
And they're not kidding about the killing—every up and comer in the Corporation has his own crew of Solos and Netrunners to cover his pet projects. Sabo­ tage? Constantly. Bribery? Routine. Black­ mail? Common. Promotion by assassina­ tion? Always a possibiIty. The stakes are that high—one slip and you could be out on the Street with the rest of the trash. Or dead.
And the projects your supervisors give you!
Some are pretty straightforward; design a new p ro d u ctivity schedule fo r the Corporation's medical subsidiary. Some are pretty raw—send a "black operations" team into the City to spread a designer plague so the Marketing team can clean up selling the vaccine. Last week, you led a mixed team of
Solos,'Runners andTechies on a headhunting run to kidnap a researcher from a rival com­ pany. The week before, your project was to steal plans for a new suborbital shuttle from the EuroSpace Agency (so that the Aero­ space Division could copy the design and sell it to the Soviets).
You told yourself you joined the Corporation to make it a better place—work from the inside, you said. But nowyou're notso sure.
Your ideals are a little tarnished and things are getting pretty bleak. But you can't worry about ethics now. You've got a report due in an hour, and it looks like that guy in Sales is planning to ice your database for good.
You're gonna ice him first.</p>
