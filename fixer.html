<p id="desc">You realized fast thatyou weren't ever going to get into a Corporate job. And you didn't think you were tough enough or crazy enough to be a Solo either. But as a small time punk, you knew you had a knack for figuring out what other people wanted, and how togetitforthem . Fora price, of course.
Now your deals have moved past the nickle- and-dime stuff into the big time. Maybe you move illegal weapons over the border. Or steal and resell medical supplies from the Corporations. Perhaps you're a skill broker—
acting as an agent for high priced Solos and 'Runners, or even hiring a whole Nomad pack to back a client's contracts. You buy and sell favors like an old-style Mafia godfather.
You have connections into all kinds of busi­ nesses, deals and political groups. You don't do this directly, of course— no, you use your contacts and allies as part of a vast web of intrigue and coersion. If there's a hot night­ club in the City, you've bought into it. If there are new military-class weapons on the Street, you smuggled 'em in. If there's a Corporate war going down, you're negotiating be­ tween sides with an eye on the main chance.
But you're not entirely in it for the bucks. If someone needs to get the heat off, you'll hide them. You get people housing when there isn't any, and you bring in food when the neighbor­ hoods are blockaded.
Maybe you do it because you know they'll owe you later, but you're not sure.
You're one part Robin Hood and two parts Al Capone.
Back in the 90's, they would have called you a crimelord.
But this is the fragmented, nasty, deadly 2020s. Now they call you a Fixer.</p>
