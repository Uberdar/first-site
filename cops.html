<p id="desc">In the old days, they only used to shoot at cops. Nowyou're lucky ifyoujusttakeaslug.
The Street is mean these days, filled with new drugs, new gangs, and new weapons that make an M-16 look like a kid's toy. If you're on a City Force, you know how bad it is.
You're carrying at least four high caliber weapons, most of them full-auto types, wear­ ing a Kevlar vest that'll stop 850 ft/lbs per square inch—and you're still outgunned and outflanked. Half the gangs are cyber to begin with—super speed, super reflexes, can see in the dark, carry weapons in their arms...The other half are freelance Corpo- i rate meres—gangs hired by the Corps to enforce their policies on the Street. And there you are—a beat cop or detective in an
armored squadcar, pa­ trolling this jungle with the heavy predators.
The Corporate Cops— now that's the life. Heavy weapons, full combatar- mor, Trauma Team™ backup, AV-4 assault ve­ hicles and gyrocopters with miniguns. But they only patrol the sectors of the C ity th a t the Government's licensed them for. The nice, clean sectors full of new office buildings and fancy res­ taurants— where no jacked up psychopunk is going to ever go on a killing spree with an AK- 47. You get the bad sections. Burned out buildings and aban- doned cars, where every night is a new firefight and another great opportunity for a messy death.
If you're really unlucky, you might draw PsychoSquad detail. PsychoSquad guys get the job of hunting down heavily armed and armored cyborgs who've flipped out. Sure, the PS guys have access to railguns, gyros andAVs. But a cyberpsycho can walk through machine gun fire and not feel it. A lot of the Psycho Squad detectives are crazy them­ selves. They load up with, boosted reflexes, get some monsterously huge guns, and go hunt the cyborgs solo. But you're not that crazy.
