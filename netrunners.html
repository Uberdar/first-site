<p id="desc">At three, your parents bought you an old Apple IV GS with a Radius 241 wall screen, and your life was changed. By fifth grade, you'd already mastered everything the school computer literacy lab could throw at you— you were already using C and META-LI NGUA to crack into the district's mainframe and change your grades. When you were thir­ teen, you shifted enough funds out of unpro­ tected TransAmerican Bank accounts to fi­ nance your first neural interface plugs.
Now, nothing can stop you. W ith your direct mental link to the computer, you can plunge
headfirst into the dizzying data-winds of the Net; the worldwide telecommu­ nications system that joins humanity together. As an electronic wraith, you are the ultimate "hacker", your brain wired into special modems and com­ puter links. You slip into the "hardest" mainframe systems w ith ease. Your de­ fense and offense programs are arrayed at a touch of your mental fingertips— a quick jolt of Demon or Vampire and the data fortresses fall. EBM. ITT. Sony- Matsushita-Ford. You've tackled them all, buying, trading and selling their deepest secrets at will.
Sometimes you uncover im portant things— Corporate treachery or deadly secrets. But that's not w hy you Netrun. You live for the new program, the next satellite downlink— the next piece of hot data that comes your way. It's only a matter of time, you think— every year, the counter intrustion programs getbetter, the Artificial Intelligences smarter.
Sooner or later, a faster program or programmer's going to catch up; reach out w ith electronic fingers through your inter­ face plugs, and stopyour heart. But time's on yourside, and until the ride runs out, you'll be there, barebrained and headfirst in the Net.</p>
